# 💰 Dual Credit System - Complete Pricing Analysis

## 🚨 **PROBLEM KYA THA?**

### **Old System (Single Credit Pool):**

```
School buys: Starter Plan (₹499) = 500 credits

100 students hai school mein
Har student din mein 5 AI questions = 10 credits (5 × 2)
100 students × 10 credits/day = 1000 credits/day needed

Result: 500 credits ÷ 1000/day = 0.5 days
         Credits 12 घंटे में khatam! 😱

Admin ko har 12 घंटे मेंplan renew karna padta
Monthly cost: ₹499 × 60 = ₹29,940/month
TOTALLY UNAFFORDABLE FOR VILLAGE SCHOOLS! ❌
```

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION: DUAL CREDIT SYSTEM**

### **2-Level Architecture:**

```
LEVEL 1 - SCHOOL CREDITS (Admin)
   ↓
Shared pool for emergency/backup
Used when personal credits = 0

LEVEL 2 - PERSONAL CREDITS (Individual)
   ↓
Student/Teacher ka apna wallet
First priority - personal use karo
₹10 se recharge (bahut sasta!)
```

### **Usage Priority (Automatic):**
1. **First:** Personal credits use
2. **Second:** If personal = 0 → School credits use
3. **Third:** If both = 0 → Soft limit (works with warning)

## 💡 **REAL SCENARIO ANALYSIS**

### **Case Study: Village School - 100 Students**

#### **Admin buys: Starter Plan (₹499)**

**What admin gets:**
- 500 school credits (shared pool)
- 10 credits per student automatically (100 × 10 = 1000)
- 10 credits per teacher (10 × 10 = 100)

**Total credits available immediately:** 500 + 1000 + 100 = **1600 credits**  
**Admin cost:** ₹499 (one-time for 90 days)

#### **Daily Usage (Realistic):**

```
100 students:
   - 70 students inactive (don't use AI)
   - 20 students light use (2 questions/day = 4 credits)
   - 10 students heavy use (10 questions/day = 20 credits)

Daily consumption:
   Light: 20 × 4 = 80 credits
   Heavy: 10 × 20 = 200 credits
   Total: 280 credits/day

1600 credits ÷ 280/day = 5.7 days of FREE use

After 6 days:
   Heavy users: Personal credits khatam
   → They recharge ₹20 (50 credits)
   → 10 students × ₹20 = ₹200 revenue
   → School admin ko kuch nahi dena
```

#### **Monthly Analysis:**

**Month 1:**
- Admin spends: ₹499 (one-time)
- Students recharge: ~₹500 (heavy users only)
- **Total cost to school: ₹499**
- **Total credits available: 1600 + student recharges (2500+)**
- **Admin tension-free!** ✅

**Month 2 & 3:**
- Admin spends: ₹0 (plan valid for 90 days)
- Students recharge: ~₹500/month
- **Total cost to school: ₹0**
